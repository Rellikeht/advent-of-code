# advent-of-code

My solutions to different editions of advent of code

Solution code for part 1 is located in sol1.[language of choice extension]
file, and for part 2 in sol2.[the same extension], all of them need to have
input supplied from command line such as:
```
cat input | ./sol1[.extension if it need to be compiled otherwise absent]
```
Because writing programs like that is usually easier and simpler :)
