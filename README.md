# advent-of-code

My solutions to different editions of advent of code

Solution code for part 1 is located in sol1.[language of choice
extension] file, and for part 2 in sol2.[language of choice
extension], in some rare cases there is only one file
sol.[language of choice extension].
Almost all of them need to have input supplied from command line such
as:

```
cat input | [name of binary or source file in interpreted languages] [args]
```

Because writing programs like that is usually easier and simpler :)

And sometimes (especially in newer solutions):

```
[name of binary or source file in interpreted languages] input [args]
```
